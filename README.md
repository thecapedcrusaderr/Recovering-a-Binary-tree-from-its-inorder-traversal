# Recovering-a-Binary-tree-using-only-inorder-traversal-of-Tree
It contains file that takes a binary tree as input and then find its inorder traversal, while finding its inordrer traversal it extracts minimal extra information like in this case height of every node. Through this inordrer traversal and information it recovers the original binary tree.
